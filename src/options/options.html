<h2> There's just one simple checkbox: </h2>
<p><input type="checkbox" id="id-editor-insert-thumbnails">   include links thumbnails in emails you write</p>

<p>
<strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p></p>

<p> When you write an email, Iframely can try to find a thumbnail image for the link, article or actual photo that you share. 
	<br>If found, Iframely can then include this image right into the body of your email so your friends see the preview when they receive it. </p>
	<p>It is a way to help your friends decide quickly, wheather they want to open link now or save for later, <br>thus to help them be more productive, especially on mobile devices.</p>
